<HTML><BODY>This work, originally written in Dutch in 1865, gives a prediction for the future after 200 years. Now almost 140 years later, it makes quite an interesting read. The Dutch original (in its second edition from 1870, and hence called Anno 2070) is already in Project Gutenberg. This English translation was from 1871, and hence its title A.D. 2071.
